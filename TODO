(probably an incomplete list)

- more grammars
- "what can i say?" command to print example voice commands
- add console support
- support for different keyboards/character sets
- add wm dock ui
- error checking in xml (currently we segfault if expr is missing, for example)
- double check async processing concerns, especially if we may be getting grammar
  requests from the window list & the voice engine at the same time.
- better gnome autoconf checking?

- Add support for gnome enlightenment key shortcuts (switch windows/desktops)
- Add support home/insert/functionkeys etc.
- Add proper correction support (This will not be possible until IBM build it into the Linux ViaVoice engine...)
